# 🍔 BURPIT - Food Delivery & Order Management System 

**BURPIT** is a feature-rich C-based food delivery and order management system designed to simulate a real-world food delivery application. This console-based project supports both **admin** and **customer** functionalities, making it a great learning project for understanding file handling, data structures, authentication, and dynamic memory management in C.

## 🔧 Project Overview
**BURPIT** enables:
- Seamless **user registration and login**
- Intuitive **menu browsing and management**
- Robust **order placement, cancellation, and processing**
- Real-time **delivery route optimization using Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- Secure **payment handling**
- Clear **order history and sales reporting**
